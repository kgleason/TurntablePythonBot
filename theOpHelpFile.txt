Since you appear to be one of my operators, you can also do the following in a private message with me:
bop : make me give this song an awesome, regardless of the state of the room.
snag : I'll add the current song to my playlist
step up : Make me a DJ
step down : Get me off the stage
dq <Position#> : remove the person at <Position#> from the DJ Queue
pop : remove the person in first place in the DJ Queue. The same as 'dq 1'
theme = <room theme> : set & announce the theme for the room
die : cause the python process to exit. Can only be executed by the owner.
